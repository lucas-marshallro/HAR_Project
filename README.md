## conf_3tx.txt

This file contains the mmWave Studio Lua shell (CLI) commands required to configure the sensor to use three Tx antennas. By inputting these commands, there is no need to use the SensorConfig tab in the interface to configure the chirps manually. The remaining configurations were set using the Connection, Static Config (ensure all three Tx channels are enabled), and DataConfig tabs.

## extract_XXX.m

These files contain MATLAB scripts that read the .bin file generated by mmWave Studio, identify each frame for feature extraction, visualize the sample sequence, and save the processed sample. The variable actionName must be modified according to the activity being recorded in order to save the sample in the appropriate folder. Samples are stored in a folder named MyDataset_XXX, with subfolders corresponding to each actionName, and are numbered sequentially to keep track of the dataset size.

## master_extract.m

This file contains a MATLAB script that calls each extract_XXX script, allowing the creation of samples for all feature types from a single sensor capture.

## HAR_Detection_Models.ipynb

This file contains a Jupyter notebook that uploads the datasets, creates data structures for training, defines the machine learning models used for classification, and trains/tests each model for every feature type. Due to the computational limitations of a standard PC and the size of the datasets, this code was executed on Google Colab using the TPU v5e-1 environment.
